My mod where I put Effort in to the Zombie Mode

Custom human enemies (Many) 🎉🙌🎊

a BUG that acts as a Feature to make it HELL FOR YOU (stops ground Ally's from attacking when too many flying allies are attacking) 😡🫤😤

SECRET TACTIC (small help Save up Glu from samurai mode finish all levels to 70 only then move to zombie mode) 🤬😭😮‍💨

Impossible Mode in Zombie mode it is just when you reach a certain level it gets ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE and you will see TON of new units (when you are playing the Last levels) 🥳🫠🥲

Custom 2 Map day/night with Music in Impossible mode 😨💀👺

Creative Waves!!! 🌟🤩✨

And Many more to Come in the Future!!! 🎉🥳🎊

Main and Hardest Feature added:
You Will Give up and leave the game!
Rage quit 🤬 - feeling bored 😮‍💨 - Frustrated 🫩 - or sad 😭.

One Wrong Tactic and Smart planning and you Can Restart Your Progress from complete Beginning or you can grind for Glu! 😵😩🤬
